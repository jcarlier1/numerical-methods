# Numerical Methods

MATLAB project with assignments and exercises for a Numerical Methods course.

## Structure

* `numerical-methods.prj` — MATLAB Project file (recommended way to open).
* `misc/` — small experiments and helper scripts.
* `resources/project/` — figures, data, and handouts.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jcarlier1/numerical-methods.git
   ```
2. Open `numerical-methods.prj` in MATLAB (sets paths automatically).
3. Run scripts or Live Scripts (`.m` / `.mlx`) inside assignment folders.

## Notes

* Use `addpath(genpath(pwd))` if not opening as a project.
* Results/outputs should be kept outside version control.
